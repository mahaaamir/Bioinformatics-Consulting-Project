**Project description as provided by the client:**
We have pool-seq data from pooled individuals in 2 populations and we want to map it to our new genome assembly and pull out markers that exhibit a signature of selection, ie FST outliers. In the past I've used programs like Poppoolation2 but I'm sure there are others. Ideally we could add these markers to a track in our Jbrowser genome site. 

**Overview**:  

Two different populations of a marine species : one from New Jersey and one from California. These populations exist slightly different phenotypes with respect to their offspring.
